#MovieLens-25M Web App with Django and Mongo

movieSort.ipynb helps to manipulate big movielens data to create top10 list

movieRecsALS.ipynb uses ALS to recommend movies to users

Download the original data from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

After running colab notebooks it will create two additional csv files that we use on the app

_It is rather experimental than instructional_

_Hope it gives an intiution_

_Cheers!_
